# AI Design (stub)

## Status

This document is a **stub**: AI is not implemented yet (`ai-model/` is currently empty).

## Goal

Describe:

- Grade normalization (scales)
- Scoring/recommendation strategy
- Explainability (reasons, weights)
- Model versioning
- Inference contract

## Phases

1) Deterministic stub (for integration)
2) Trained model (and/or advanced heuristics)
