# Architecture (stub)

## Status

This document is a **stub**. It will be completed as `backend/`, `ai-model/`, and `mobile-app/` are implemented.

## Current state

- The web frontend is implemented in `my-future-vision/`.
- `backend/`, `ai-model/`, `mobile-app/` exist but are still empty.

## Target state

- Web frontend: UI + data collection + result rendering.
- Backend: auth, persistence, business logic, AI orchestration.
- AI: training/inference/versioning.
- Infra (optional): docker/compose, CI/CD.
