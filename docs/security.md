# Security (stub)

## Status

This document is a **stub**. It will be completed once the backend exists.

## Frontend (current state)

The frontend already contains client-side security measures (validation, sanitization, limits, “frontend” rate limiting).

## Backend (target)

To be defined when `backend/` is implemented:

- Auth (JWT/refresh or other)
- Server-side rate limiting
- Strict input/output validation
- Audit logs
- Retention policy (files/logs)
