# Mobile App (reserved)

This folder is **reserved** for the MyFuture AI mobile application.

## Status

- Current: **empty**.
- Goal: share contracts (API) and the data model with the web app as much as possible.

## Recommended strategy

- Consume the same backend as the web app.
- Reuse the same i18n and validation conventions (potentially via a shared package later).

## Decisions to make when starting

- Stack: React Native / Flutter / other.
- Auth (JWT/refresh) and secure storage.
- Offline/online strategy.
